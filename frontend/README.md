This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Legal pages

`/impressum` and `/datenschutz` use the same Material UI theme as the consultant.
Configure the public provider details at build time:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_LEGAL_NAME=Leon Koch
NEXT_PUBLIC_LEGAL_STREET=Street and house number
NEXT_PUBLIC_LEGAL_CITY=Postal code and city
NEXT_PUBLIC_LEGAL_COUNTRY=Deutschland
NEXT_PUBLIC_LEGAL_EMAIL=contact@example.com
```

These values are rendered publicly and are not secrets. A visible warning is
shown on the legal pages while any value is missing. The privacy text also
contains deployment-specific sections that must be completed with the actual
hosting provider, LLM provider, recipients, and retention periods before a
public deployment.

## Browser test

Install dependencies and Playwright's Chromium browser, then run the frontend
journey test from this directory:

```bash
npm ci
npx playwright install chromium
npm run test:e2e
```

The test starts a local Next.js server and mocks the API responses in the
browser. It checks degree selection, session creation, message submission, and
reply rendering without making an LLM call. It does not test the live backend
or the correctness of an LLM answer.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
