# Deployment (Docker / Compose / Caddy)

`docker-compose.yml` starts the backend locally. The optional static-frontend
preview uses the `frontend-preview` profile:

```text
frontend preview -> http://localhost:3000/
backend          -> http://localhost:8000
```

The optional `production` profile also starts Caddy on ports 80/443. Caddy
terminates HTTPS, serves `frontend/out` directly from `/srv`, and proxies only
backend traffic over the internal Compose network. Production therefore runs no
Node.js frontend container. Its certificate state persists in the `caddy_data`
volume.

## Two Caddyfiles, distinct roles

- Root `Caddyfile` belongs to the production `caddy` service: TLS, the `www`
  redirect, backend proxying, and the static export.
- `frontend/Caddyfile.preview` belongs only to the optional `frontend-preview`
  service; it is a minimal local static-file server and is **not** used in the
  production request path.

## Static frontend export

The frontend is a static Next.js export (`output: "export"`). Build it on the
local machine with `npm run build`; the generated `frontend/out/` directory is a
tracked deployment artifact and must be refreshed before deployment. The
browser-facing API base URL is baked into that export; the optional Docker
preview image packages the export unchanged:

```text
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_DEV_TOOLS=false
```

`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` is intentionally host-facing because the JavaScript
runs in the user's browser, not inside the Docker network.

## Environment

Compose uses `.env` as the backend env file. Keep `.env.example` aligned when
adding required runtime variables.

Compose publishes application ports on `COMPOSE_BIND_ADDRESS` and reads
`FRONTEND_PORT` (preview only), `CONSULTANT_PORT`, `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, and
`FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS` from `.env`. Keep the application bind address on loopback
when the production Caddy profile is enabled. Production additionally requires
`APP_DOMAIN`, a static export built with the matching `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`,
and matching CORS configuration.

## Build notes

The backend Dockerfile intentionally wraps apt update/install in timeouts. If
apt times out, investigate Docker network access to Debian mirrors before
changing Python dependencies.

For production, first rebuild `frontend/out/` locally and deploy the updated
repository revision, then run the production Compose profile; only `backend` and
Caddy run. Use `docker compose logs -f backend caddy` when production runtime
behavior is unclear.

## Azure target architecture

The initial Azure/Terraform stack lives in `infra/`. It provisions Azure Static
Web Apps for the static frontend, ACR plus Azure Container Apps for the backend,
Key Vault with managed-identity access for the AcademicCloud API key, and Log
Analytics. The Container App is fixed at one warm replica while sessions and
quotas remain process-local, and WizardFlow is disabled because no persistent
trace storage is provisioned.

Infrastructure creation uses a two-phase bootstrap so neither an API key nor a
nonexistent ACR image is required during the first apply. See `infra/README.md`
for the exact sequence. Custom domains, DNS cutover, remote Terraform state,
and GitHub Actions application releases are intentionally deferred.

Azure for Students policies may limit both deployment regions and ACR Tasks.
The stack supports a backend-only deployment with `deploy_frontend = false`;
when ACR Tasks are disabled, build the backend image with local Docker and push
it to ACR before enabling `deploy_backend`. The concrete commands and region
notes are in `infra/README.md`.
