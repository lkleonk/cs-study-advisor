# Study Plan Data

This document describes how the FU Berlin CS consultant currently represents, stores, and validates a student's study-program data.

## Current Storage Model

Phase 1 does not persist study-plan data to disk or a database.

The backend uses LangGraph `MemorySaver` in `backend/app/services/agent_graph_service.py`. A session is identified by `session_id`, and that ID is passed to LangGraph as:

```python
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": session_id}}
```

The graph state for that thread holds:

```text
messages
wizardflow_message_id
message_type
course_lookup_keys
course_lookup_needs_clarification
course_context
citations
parsed_study_plan
rule_check_result
reply
```

Important implications:

- The study plan is in memory only.
- The study plan is lost when the backend process restarts.
- Sessions are deleted after 48 hours of inactivity by opportunistic cleanup
  during later message or transcript requests.
- `DELETE /api/sessions/{session_id}` immediately removes inactive session
  state. If a request for that session is still running, deletion is deferred
  until the active request finishes.
- The current design is not multi-instance safe.
- WizardFlow writes a local diagnostic trace, but there is no authoritative
  study-plan audit database. Deleting a session does not delete trace files.
- There is no dedicated endpoint yet for reading or editing a study plan.
- A parsed plan exists only after a message has gone through the `plan_check` path.

## Data Flow

```text
POST /api/sessions            # optional body {"degree": "<degree_id>"}
  -> SessionService.create_session(degree_id)
  -> seeds degree_id into the LangGraph checkpoint
  -> returns session_id + degree

POST /api/sessions/{session_id}/message
  -> SessionService.process_message()
  -> LangGraph ainvoke(..., thread_id=session_id)
  -> agent graph updates in-memory ConsultantState

DELETE /api/sessions/{session_id}
  -> SessionService.delete_session()
  -> MemorySaver.delete_thread(session_id)
```

For a normal study question, the graph may store exact course-offering lookup
context and citations, but no study plan.

For a plan-check message, the graph stores:

```text
parsed_study_plan
rule_check_result
```

The API response includes `rule_check_result` when available.

When a later chat message adds or corrects plan information, the parser receives
both the existing `parsed_study_plan` JSON and the latest user message. It must
return one complete updated plan, preserving existing modules while incorporating
the new information. The returned complete plan replaces the previous state and
is enriched and validated again. Initial chat plans and transcript uploads have
no existing-plan input and retain the normal full-plan parsing flow.

## StudyPlan Schema

The canonical in-process schema lives in `backend/app/domain/study_plan.py` and
is shared by all degree programs. Degree-specific semantics live in each degree
package: the parser's JSON schema (`DegreeDefinition.study_plan_schema`)
constrains which fields the LLM fills per degree, and the degree's validator
interprets them. For `msc_informatik` all fields below are used; for
`msc_data_science` the parser only fills `name`, `lp`, and `area`
(`thesis`/`unknown`) — classification happens deterministically against the
canonical module catalogue, and `specialization_area` plus the boolean flags
stay at their defaults.

```python
class StudyPlan(BaseModel):
    specialization_area: Literal["practical", "theoretical", "technical"] | None
    modules: list[PlannedModule]
```

The specialization area is the chosen Vertiefung:

- `practical`
- `theoretical`
- `technical`
- `None` when not supplied or not parseable

## PlannedModule Schema

```python
class PlannedModule(BaseModel):
    name: str
    lp: int
    area: Literal[
        "practical",
        "theoretical",
        "technical",
        "application",
        "thesis",
        "unknown",
    ]
    is_wahlbereich: bool
    is_ungraded: bool
    is_bachelor_module: bool
    is_scientific_work: bool
    is_software_project: bool
```

Field meaning:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `name` | Module name as parsed from the user or normalized from the catalog. |
| `lp` | Leistungspunkte. Missing LP defaults to `0` and becomes a validation error. |
| `area` | Subject area used for LP totals and specialization checks. |
| `is_wahlbereich` | Whether the module is explicitly counted in Wahlbereich. |
| `is_ungraded` | Whether the module is ungraded or non-differentiated. |
| `is_bachelor_module` | Whether the module counts toward the Bachelor-module cap. |
| `is_scientific_work` | Whether it is a Wissenschaftliches Arbeiten module. |
| `is_software_project` | Whether it is a Softwareprojekt module. |

## User Data vs Inferred Data

The study plan parser extracts what the user says. Then the degree's
`enrich_study_plan` fills in deterministic knowledge: `msc_informatik` enriches
through `module_catalog.py` using `module_catalog.json`; `msc_data_science`
canonicalizes matched names and default LP from its module catalogue in
`domain/degrees/msc_data_science/module_catalog.py`.

User-provided data can include:

- module name
- LP
- area
- specialization area
- whether a module is in Wahlbereich
- whether a module is ungraded
- whether a module is a Bachelor module

Catalog-inferred data can include:

- canonical module name
- LP
- area
- ungraded marker
- Bachelor-module marker
- Wissenschaftliches Arbeiten marker
- Softwareprojekt marker

The implementation intentionally keeps the LLM out of final validation. The LLM may parse a plan, but `degree_rules.py` decides whether the plan passes.

## Wahlbereich Handling

`is_wahlbereich` is separate from `area`.

This matters because a module can still belong to a subject area, for example `technical`, while being counted in Wahlbereich for the seminar/project maximum caveat.

Current behavior:

- Wahlbereich LP is reported as `wahlbereich_lp`.
- Wahlbereich LP must not exceed 10 LP.
- Core Softwareprojekt count excludes modules with `is_wahlbereich=true`.
- Total Softwareprojekt count includes them.
- Core Wissenschaftliches Arbeiten count excludes modules with `is_wahlbereich=true`.
- Total Wissenschaftliches Arbeiten count includes them.

This implements the caveat:

- Core Softwareprojekt modules: at least 1 and at most 2.
- One extra Softwareprojekt can be placed in Wahlbereich, allowing 3 total.
- Core Wissenschaftliches Arbeiten modules: at least 2 and at most 4.
- Up to 2 extra Wissenschaftliches Arbeiten modules can be placed in Wahlbereich, because seminars are 5 LP and Wahlbereich is 10 LP.

## RuleCheckResult Schema

Validation output is produced by the session degree's validator
(`backend/app/domain/degrees/<degree>/degree_rules.py`); the shared
`RuleIssue`/`RuleCheckResult` models live in `backend/app/domain/rule_check.py`.

```python
class RuleCheckResult(BaseModel):
    is_valid: bool
    summary: str
    totals: dict[str, int]
    issues: list[RuleIssue]
```

The `totals` dict currently includes:

```text
practical_lp
theoretical_lp
technical_lp
application_lp
informatics_lp
module_area_lp
thesis_lp
master_total_lp
ungraded_lp
bachelor_module_lp
wahlbereich_lp
core_scientific_work_count
total_scientific_work_count
core_software_project_count
total_software_project_count
```

Each issue has:

```python
class RuleIssue(BaseModel):
    code: str
    severity: Literal["error", "warning"]
    message: str
    details: dict[str, Any]
```

## Current Limitations

- No persistent student profile exists.
- No explicit `GET /api/sessions/{id}/study-plan` endpoint exists.
- No explicit `PUT /api/sessions/{id}/study-plan` endpoint exists.
- The study plan is extracted from chat text, with follow-up messages applied by
  asking the parser to reproduce the complete updated plan; it is not edited
  through a structured API.
- Because the LLM reproduces the complete plan on a follow-up, an incorrect
  omission or alteration is still possible and should remain visible to the user
  in the Study Plan tab.
- The parser may miss modules when the user writes an ambiguous or incomplete plan.
- Unknown modules can still be included, but they need explicit LP and area data or they produce validation issues/warnings.

## Recommended Phase 2 Persistence

The next clean step is to make the study plan an explicit resource:

```text
GET  /api/sessions/{id}/study-plan
PUT  /api/sessions/{id}/study-plan
POST /api/sessions/{id}/study-plan/check
```

For quick local development, store JSON files:

```text
backend/data/sessions/{session_id}.json
```

Suggested shape:

```json
{
  "session_id": "uuid",
  "created_at": "iso-8601",
  "updated_at": "iso-8601",
  "study_plan": {
    "specialization_area": "practical",
    "modules": []
  },
  "last_rule_check_result": null
}
```

For real deployment, move the same schema to SQLite or Postgres. The API contract should stay the same so the storage backend can change later.
